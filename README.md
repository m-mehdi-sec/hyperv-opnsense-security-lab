# Hyper-V OPNsense Security Lab

A hands-on **cybersecurity home lab** built using **Microsoft Hyper-V** and **OPNsense firewall** to simulate a realistic small enterprise network.

This project demonstrates practical skills in **network design, segmentation, firewall configuration, troubleshooting and dual-stack (IPv4/IPv6) networking**.

The lab is developed as a **portfolio project** to showcase real-world networking and cybersecurity capabilities.

---

## Lab Overview

This lab simulates a **segmented internal network environment** using virtualization.

Key components:

- Hyper-V virtualization platform
- OPNsense firewall acting as router and gateway
- Multiple virtual machines (Windows & Linux-based systems)
- Network segmentation using multiple subnets (LAN & LAN2)

## Implemented Phases

### Phase 1 – Initial Deployment

- Deployed OPNsense firewall in Hyper-V
- Created and configured virtual switches (WAN & LAN)
- Connected multiple virtual machines to the internal network
- Configured DHCP for automatic IP assignment

---

### Phase 2 – Network Verification & Troubleshooting

- Verified connectivity between all virtual machines
- Tested communication with default gateway
- Validated internet access (NAT)
- Identified DHCP issue on LAN2 (APIPA address)
- Diagnosed and resolved DHCP configuration problem
- Performed network testing using ICMP (ping)

---

### Phase 3 – Network Segmentation & IPv6

- Implemented a second internal network (LAN2)
- Configured network segmentation
- Introduced IPv6 alongside IPv4 (dual-stack)
- Verified IPv6 connectivity between hosts
- Tested internet access through NAT
